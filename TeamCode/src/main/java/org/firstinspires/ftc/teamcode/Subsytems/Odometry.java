    *  OdoTPR - The amount of ticks per revoloution of the odometry pod.
    *           should only ever be changed when the odometry pods are changed out
    *
    *  C - this is the circumfrence of the odometry sensor. its 2 * PI * Radius.
    *      The current radius is 16, this should be changed when odometry pods
    *      are changed, and only the 16 should be changed to the new radius value
    *      and nothing else
    *
    *  L - This is the distance between the two parrallel odometry sensors. This
    *      variable should only be changed when the odometry sensors are moved
    *      (This will probably happen with every iteration of the robot)
    *
    *  B - This is the distance between the perpindicular odometry sensor and the
    *      center of the robot (The center line that is parrallel to the sensor).
    *      This variable should only be changed when the odometry sensors are moved
    *      (This will probably happen with every iteration of the robot)
